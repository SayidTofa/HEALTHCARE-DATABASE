Track the number of employees in different roles (e.g., doctors, nurses, technicians).

Patient Records & Appointments:
Maintain patient information, including personal details, medical history, and assigned doctors.
Schedule, update, and manage appointments efficiently.

Medical Records & Treatments:
Record patient diagnoses and prescribed treatments.
Link patients with doctors and treatment histories.

Financial Management:
Keep track of employee salaries and financial transactions related to medical services.
Manage billing for patients and health center expenditures.

## Key Insights
Employee Structure & Payroll:
The dataset includes employees from various medical fields (surgeons, general practitioners, lab technicians, dentists, etc.) with salaries based on seniority.
High specialization roles, such as surgeons, have significantly higher salaries.
